THESIS: Make best execution inspectable without turning a focused swap into a crowded terminal.
OWN-WORLD: Lumix's dark-default, theme-adaptive Poly Blue and Pure Gray system, compact raised controls, quiet borders, Inter labels, and tabular mono financial values.
STORY: Choose assets and size, inspect route quality and prerequisites, review intent, then follow the wallet-to-ledger lifecycle.
FIRST VIEWPORT: A compact shell frames one centered two-column workspace; the wider swap ticket leads on the left, route evidence sits beside it, and the commit closes the ticket.
FORM: Established-world extension, first-ranked execution receipt structure; seed key established-world/direct-brief.
FINISH: unreviewed and undocumented is unfinished; this build ends with the finish review, the verdict, DESIGN.md, and every shipping raster carrying its provenance
